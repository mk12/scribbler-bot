# Scribbler Bot

Scribbler Bot is a project that we, group 22, are developing for SE 101 in 1A Software Engineering at Waterloo. It is written in Python and uses the [Myro][1] library to control a robot.

## Templates

The HTML files for this project (all two of them) are generated from a template, so the first thing you have to do is run that script:

```
python gen-templates.py
```

## Server

Now, you must start the server:

```
python src/main.py
```

Use the `-h` flag to see what other options there are.

## Client

The web browser should have opened to `http://localhost:8080` automatically. You control Scribbler Bot via this web app. By clicking the buttons, you can choose a program, start/stop/reset the program, adjust the robot's speed, make it beep, display some information about the robot, clear the console, and toggle automatic scrolling of the console.

## Object avoidance

The first assignment is to program the Scribbler Bot to avoid obstacles. More details will be included here soon.

## Real task

After each group member has submitted a proposal and one has been selected, we will start work on the main part of the project.
