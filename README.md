# Scribbler Bot

Scribbler Bot is a project that we, group 22, are developing for SE 101 in 1A Software Engineering at Waterloo. It is written in Python and uses the [Myro][1] library to control a robot.

## Web front end

All user input for the Scribbler Bot is done via a web app. The `public` folder is served by `server.py`, and we use AJAX to communicate with the server.

## Object avoidance

The first assignment is to program the Scribbler Bot to avoid obstacles. More details will be included here soon.

## Real task

After each group member has submitted a proposal and one has been selected, we will start work on the main part of the project.
